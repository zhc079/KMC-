# KMC-
kinectic monte carlo simulation of charge dynamics on a chain

1.Charge carries (holes in this example) hopping rates are calculated by Marcus Rate. 
2.Input files include:
  sites' energy, which is used to calculate HOMO/LUMO
  overlap intergral
3.The input file for KMC c++ code: nbList.txt, is generated by KMC_GetInput
